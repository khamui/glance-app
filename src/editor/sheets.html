      1. Manage your Sheets here. A good start is to list all expense and revenue types or categories
      you find relevant for your business. Usually you have less revenue categories than expense categries.
    </p>
    <p class="notification__box">
      <button class="delete has-background-primary has-text-white">x</button>
      2. Next go on and fill in the values you know or estimate for each category. A good approximation of
      the value is enough, it does not need to be super accurate.
    </p>
    <p class="notification__box">
      <button class="delete has-background-primary has-text-white">x</button>
      3. Now refine your sheet in terms of, when do you expect the outgoing or incoming payment to happen.
      Will it happen weekly, monthly, quarterly or on one or multiple specific date/s?
